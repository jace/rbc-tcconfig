Telecentre computer configuration and network management architecture used in [Comat](http://www.comat.com/)'s Rural Business Centres, a network of over a thousand telecentres in rural areas across India.

These telecentres are on average four hours from the nearest urban area (and support centre) and have intermittent and low bandwidth network connections with frequent power outages and system meltdowns, putting the focus of this project on creating a management framework that can work under such conditions.

**This project is no longer maintained as the implementing team has moved on from Comat.**
